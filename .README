# benchmark-typescript-functions-starter
This repo contains a simple typescript starter to run a benchmark to compare performances of two functions.

In this specific example two different implementations of the [bubble sort algorithm](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort) are compared.

## Run benchmark
You can run the benchmark by running the following npm commands:
```
npm run build
npm run start
```
